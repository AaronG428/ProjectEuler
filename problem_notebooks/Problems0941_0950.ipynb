    "Consider the happiness $c(n,C,p) + p\\cdot w(n,C,p)$ of the most senior surviving pirate in the situation where $n$ pirates, all with equal bloodthirstiness $p$, have found $C$ coins. For example, $c(5,5,\\frac{1}{10}) = 3$ and $w(5,5,\\frac{1}{10})=0$ because it can be shown that if the most senior pirate proposes a distribution of $3,0,1,0,1$ coins to the pirates (in decreasing order of seniority), the three pirates receiving coins will all vote to accept. On the other hand, $c(5,1,\\frac{1}{10}) = 0$ and $w(5,1,\\frac{1}{10}) = 1$: the most senior pirate cannot survive with any proposal, and then the second most senior pirate must give the only coin to another pirate in order to survive.\n",
