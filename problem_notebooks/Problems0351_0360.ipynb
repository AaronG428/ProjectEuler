    "* If the result is positive, $5$ additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\n",

    "* We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the $25$ samples. It can be verified that in about $60.35\\%$ of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining $39.65\\%$ of the cases.\n",
    "* If we know that at least one animal in a group of $5$ is infected and the first $4$ individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).\n",
    "* We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the\n",
