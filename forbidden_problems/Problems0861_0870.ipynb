    "1. Roll both dice, obtaining integers $1\\le p\\le 6$ and $1\\le q\\le 5$.\n",

    "4. Otherwise ($r$ being 29 or 30), roll both dice again, obtaining integers $1\\le s\\le 6$ and $1\\le t\\le 5$.\n",
    "5. Compute $u = 30(r-29) + 5(s-1) + t$ to obtain an integer $1\\le u\\le 60$.\n",
    "6. If $u>4$, return the value $((u-5)\\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.\n",

    "There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows (D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,...), truncated wherever the process stops. In fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined.
