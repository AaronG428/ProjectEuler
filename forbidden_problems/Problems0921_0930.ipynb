    "Given $n\\ge 2$ bowls arranged in a circle, $m\\ge 2$ balls are distributed amongst them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially the balls are distributed randomly: for each ball, a bowl is chosen equiprobably and independently of the other balls. After this is done, we start the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose one of the $m$ balls equiprobably at random.\n",
    "2. Choose a direction to move - either clockwise or anticlockwise - again equiprobably at random.\n",
    "3. Move the chosen ball to the neighbouring bowl in the chosen direction.\n",
    "4. Return to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process stops when all the $m$ balls are located in the same bowl. Note that this may be after zero steps, if the balls happen to have been initially distributed all in the same bowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $F(n, m)$ be the expected number of times we move a ball before the process stops. For example, $F(2, 2) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $F(3, 2) = \\frac{4}{3}$, $F(2, 3) = \\frac{9}{4}$, and $F(4, 5) = \\frac{6875}{24}$.\n",

    "Let $G(N, M) = \\sum\\_{n=2}^N \\sum\\_{m=2}^M F(n, m)$. For example, $G(3, 3) = \\frac{137}{12}$ and $G(4, 5) = \\frac{6277}{12}$. You are also given that $G(6, 6) \\approx 1.681521567954e4$ in scientific format with 12 significant digits after the decimal point.\n",
